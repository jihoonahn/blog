Nice to meet you, welcome to my blog. I am a junior developer who started iOS development in 2021. During this time, I worked with small and large teams on the project.

I am interested in various architectures and technologies while developing iOS. 
And I like to challenge myself. Challenging gives me a lot of difficulties, but it gives me more experience and a sense of accomplishment.

I want to keep developing this blog and record my growth process.

Although blog posts may be lacking, please take good care of us!
